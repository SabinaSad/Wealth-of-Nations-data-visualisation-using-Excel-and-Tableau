# Wealth-of-Nations project using Excel and Tableau

Discovering Economic Insights with Wealth of Nations Data

Welcome to my repository! Here, you'll find the tools and documentation for analyzing the Wealth of Nations dataset. My project revolves around cleaning, filtering, visualizing, and analyzing the data using user-friendly tools like Excel and Tableau.


Excel Exploration at a Glance

Effortless Filtering:    With Excel's filters, I focused on specific data, diving deep into economic details for a thorough analysis.

Precision in Representation:    I fine-tuned data types to ensure accuracy, making calculations and visualizations crystal clear.

Visual Insights:          Transforming numbers into stories, I created simple yet impactful charts that reveal trends, patterns, and economic disparities.
